This test map should contain all of the code, prefabs, and collision models necessary to add destructable objects to your FMs in The Dark Mod. 
All of the assets herein are built on top of models/textures/particle effects/sound effects that ship with The Dark Mod 2.13.

Feel free to copy/modify/reshare/include in your own FMs, no attribution required.
